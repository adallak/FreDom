# FreDom
The repository contains an algorithm to implement the FreDom algorithm to learn time series DAGs as described in <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosta.2024.06.003>.
It contains four main files.

- `FreDom.py` - contains the main `FreDom` class to learn a DAG from time series data
- `postprocess.py`- contains functions for post-processing the learned DAG. Borrowed from NOTEARS.
- `utility.py` - contains various utility functions.
- `Example.ipynb ` - simple example to implement the FreDom algorithm.
